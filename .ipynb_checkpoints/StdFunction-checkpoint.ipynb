    "According to the WHO website, \"Overweight and obesity are defined as abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that presents a risk to health. A body mass index (BMI) over 25 is considered overweight, and over 30 is obese. The issue has grown to epidemic proportions, with over 4 million people dying each year as a result of being overweight or obese in 2017 according to the global burden of disease.\" (https://www.who.int/health-topics/obesity#tab=tab_1). This is particularly concerning in the case of children, where the prevalence of obesity has increased worldwide over the past 50 years. (Abarca-Gomez et al.)\n",
