    "\n",
    "According to the WHO website, \"Overweight and obesity are defined as abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that presents a risk to health. A body mass index (BMI) over 25 is considered overweight, and over 30 is obese. The issue has grown to epidemic proportions, with over 4 million people dying each year as a result of being overweight or obese in 2017 according to the global burden of disease.\" (https://www.who.int/health-topics/obesity#tab=tab_1). This is particularly concerning in the case of children, where the prevalence of obesity has increased worldwide over the past 50 years. (Abarca-Gomez et al.)\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to understand this phenomena we will take a look at some representative data compiled by the CDC and NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Estimation Survey). We will be using some standard statistical techniques to analyze the overall BMI trends in the population namely: the mean and the standard deviation. We will compute these values ourselves although the data could easily be obtained through other means as a way to learn about control loops and functions.\n",
