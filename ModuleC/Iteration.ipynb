    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the WHO website, \"Overweight and obesity are defined as abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that presents a risk to health ... The issue has grown to epidemic proportions, with over 4 million people dying each year as a result of being overweight or obese in 2017 according to the global burden of disease.\" (https://www.who.int/health-topics/obesity#tab=tab_1). This issue is particularly concerning in the case of children, where the prevalence of obesity has increased worldwide over the past 50 years. (Abarca-Gomez et al.)\n",
    "\n",
    "One popular measure of obesity is the body mass index (BMI), which can be calculated from a simple formula given a person's height and weight. In particular, the BMI is given by:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "BMI = \\frac{weight}{height^2},\n",
    "$$ where weight is measured in kilograms and height is in meters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, a BMI over 25 is considered overweight, and over 30 is obese. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to understand this phenomena we will take a look at data compiled by the CDC and NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Estimation Survey). We will be using some standard statistical techniques to analyze BMI in the population namely: the mean and the standard deviation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although the data could easily be obtained through other means, we will compute these values ourselves as a way to learn about iterations, control,  functions, and algorithms."
